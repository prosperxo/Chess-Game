# Chess-Game
This is a special chess game that uses fairy pieces such as Falcon and Hunter. In this game mode, you win if you capture the opponent's king! Falcon and Hunter chess pieces can be added in your home rows after a piece has been captured. 

There is no check or checkmate, and there is no castling, en passant, or pawn promotion. Locations on the board will be specified using algebraic notation. 

Falcon: moves forward like a bishop, and backward like a rook

Hunter: moves forward like a rook and backward like a bishop
